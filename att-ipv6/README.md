# AT&T IPv6

On ATT IPv6, the RG (residential gateway) receives a /60 prefix itself, but only hands out one /64 to routers in IP Passthrough mode, regardless how big of a prefix was requested.  The RG keeps the lower 8 /64s for its own purposes (`2600:1700:X:yyy0::/63`), and Unifi normally only receives `2600:1700:X:yyyf::/64`.

This script enables UDM to receive up to 8 PDs on ATT IPv6 (tested with RG BGW320-500), usually starting at `2600:1700:X:yyyf::/64` down to `2600:1700:X:yyy8::/64`.
Note that these may not always be assigned contiguous or in order.

The price to pay is that almost none of the IPv6 support native to UDM remains enabled, hence options like DHCPv6 cannot be changed in the UI anymore.
Firewall and routing rules remain functional, however.

## Requirements

1. You have successfully setup the on boot script described [here](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script)
2. You must set up the ATT RG in ["IP Passthrough" mode](https://patrickdomingues.com/2022/09/03/udm-pro-vpn-on-att-fiber-bgw320/)
3. You must turn off IPv6 on the ATT WAN connection, AND on each network/VLAN (IPv6 Interface Type: None)
4. You must add Firewall rules equivalent to (this can be done in the UI, select `Internet v6 Local` chain)
    ```
    -A UBIOS_WAN_LOCAL_USER -p udp -m udp --sport 547 --dport 546 -j RETURN   # select IPv6 Protocol "UDP" and create port groups for source port 547 and dest port 546
    -A UBIOS_WAN_LOCAL_USER -p ipv6-icmp -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 134 -j RETURN # select IPv6 Protocol "ICMPv6" and IPv6ICMP  Type Name "Router Advertisement"
    ```
5. You may want to add a "Traffic Management" route on your ATT WAN device to access 192.168.1.254/32, so that you can access the RG after it is in passthrough mode.

## Customization

Near the top of `10-att-ipv6.sh`:

    ```sh
    wan_iface="eth8"            # use "eth9" for UDM Pro WAN2
    vlans="br0"                 # "br0 br100 br101..."
    domain="example.invalid"    # DNS domain
    dns6="[2001:4860:4860::8888],[2001:4860:4860::8844]" # Google
    ```

This generates configuration files in directory `/mnt/data/att-ipv6`, if they don't exist.
The files can be edited, or regenerated by deleting them and re-running the script.

## Installation

    ```sh
    cd /mnt/data/on_boot.d
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/HEAD/att-ipv6/10-att-ipv6.sh
    chmod +x 10-att-ipv6.sh
    ./10-att-ipv6.sh
    ```

The dhcpcd container being used is built [here](https://github.com/michaelw/dhcpcd-container/pkgs/container/dhcpcd)

## Validation

Running the script starts dhcpcd within the `att-ipv6` container on `eth8` (WAN1) and only for the default network (`br0`).  This can be customized, see above.

To check that everything is working as expected, and the ATT RG delegates multiple prefixes:

On UDM:
```sh
ip -6 r               # should see a default route on the WAN interface, and a 2600:1700:X:Y::/64 prefix on each configured VLAN bridge interface
podman logs att-ipv6  # should see dhcpcd successfully acquiring prefixes
ps auxw|grep dnsmasq  # should see dnsmasq running
```

On BGW320-500, check https://192.168.1.254/cgi-bin/lanstatistics.ha for multiple PDs in `IPv6 Delegated Prefix Subnet (including length)`.


On clients:
```
ip -6 addr show # should see SLAAC and/or DHCPv6 addresses received (if not, check dnsmasq configuration in `/run/dnsmasq.conf.d`)
```

### Useful commands

```sh
# View dhcpcd logs to verify the container is running without error (ipv6 logs from dhcpcd are normal).
podman logs att-ipv6

# Restart dhcpcd (e.g., after configuration change)
podman exec -it dhcpcd -x

# Stop the container
podman stop att-ipv6

# Remove the container
podman rm att-ipv6
```
